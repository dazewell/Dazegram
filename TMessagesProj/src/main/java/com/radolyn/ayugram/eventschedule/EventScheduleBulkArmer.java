/**
 * Arms one shared event-schedule trigger across a bulk reschedule, using deferred atomic
 * activation: nothing is armed while the reschedule is in flight. At finalization the dialog's unbound
 * durable orphans are reconciled first -- a step that MAY yield to a storage hop -- and only once that
 * reconcile completes is the whole selection published in a single UI-thread turn. So the safety
 * argument is deliberately NOT "one synchronous turn": it rests on the admission suppression, the
 * deletion collector, the run's (account, dialogId) generation and each target's owner revision all
 * spanning that hop -- see finalizeOnUi for the full statement. Progressive arming is deliberately
 * avoided -- a trigger firing mid-run would enrol only the armed prefix and leave the rest needing a
 * second key phrase, which is the exact problem this feature exists to remove.
 *
 * <p>One instance per run. The bulk-reschedule handler builds it on the UI thread with the shared
 * trigger config, the dialog, and the full album child-id set of every selected message, then hands
 * it to {@link RescheduleSpreadExecutor#run} as its
 * {@link RescheduleSpreadExecutor.TriggerArmingHooks}.
