     * <p>Model E. Each glyph is scaled so its ink bounding box reaches a preferred width of 83.3% of
     * the 24dp canvas (20/24, the band the icons nobody complained about already sit in), then held
     * inside an ink-area band of 14-23% so a dense glyph cannot read as a blob or a sparse one as a
     * smudge, then capped at 92% width and 94% height so nothing runs to the canvas edge. Width leads
     * because in a horizontal row the gap the eye reads is horizontal, and the complaint that started
     * this ("excessive padding") was about that gap. Where the constraints fight, the cap wins and the
     * glyph is left off target rather than given a private exception. One entry, schedule, is a stated
     * exception to that rule - see its comment below for why width-normalisation fails it and what it
     * costs.
     *
     * <p>Every number here is output from {@code Tools/scripts/IconInk.java} measuring the drawable the
     * button actually draws - not the registry asset, where the two differ - and may only ever be
     * re-measured, never nudged. The trailing comment on each line is the measurement it came from:
     * ink area, then ink bounding box, both as a percentage of the canvas. Where that drawable is a
     * {@code CombinedDrawable} layering a differently-tinted accent over the glyph rather than more
     * glyph ink (schedule's badge dot, see its entry below), the accent is measured out of the area
     * term - left in, it drives the area cap and shrinks the whole glyph to fit an accent that was
     * never meant to read as ink.
     *
     * <p>Nothing is baked into an asset any more. Under the toolbar's FIT_CENTER icon box a runtime
     * scale and a {@code <group>} scale are the same transform, so keeping it here makes the row
     * reviewable in one place instead of spread across twenty files, and stops the fork carrying
     * copies of upstream drawables that quietly stop tracking it. Fork an asset only to *move* ink,
     * which a scale cannot do.
