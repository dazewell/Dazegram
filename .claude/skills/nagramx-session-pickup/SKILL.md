description: "Dazewell's protocol for starting work on a NagramX change already in progress — a branch or PR an earlier session left unfinished. Trigger it at the start of any session told it is continuing, resuming, picking up, taking over or finishing an existing branch or PR; whenever the working tree is on a dated feature branch carrying commits this session did not write; and when dazewell points at a branch, a PR number or an old change and asks what is left. It applies whether or not a handoff was ever written — an abandoned branch with no handoff is the harder and more common case. Covers: reconstructing state from git, the PR body, CI and review threads rather than from narration; the order to read them in; treating the diff as authoritative over a stale handoff; honouring recorded dead ends; not re-litigating settled hook points, UX rulings or dispositioned findings; not re-reviewing finished work; and confirming the reconstruction before building. The outgoing side is nagramx-session-handoff."

# Picking up a change already in flight

You have been pointed at a branch or a PR you did not write. Everything you need
is on disk and on GitHub; none of it is in your context yet. **Reconstruct
before you build.**

This is the incoming half of `nagramx-session-handoff`, but it applies equally
when nobody wrote a handoff at all — a branch abandoned without ceremony, or one
from weeks ago. That case is the harder one and the more common one.

## 1. Read the artifacts, in this order

Do not skip ahead to the code. The order matters: shape first, then detail.

**Bind the target before you read anything.** Every command below resolves
against `HEAD`, so establish that `HEAD` *is* the change you were pointed at —
otherwise you can reconstruct, and later modify, the wrong branch entirely. In a
worktree sitting on something else, this is the whole failure.

```powershell
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD                    # what am I actually on
```

If that is not the target branch, resolve it before continuing. Given a branch
name, `git switch <branch>` in this worktree, or work in the worktree that
already holds it. Given only a PR number, resolve its state *before* trying to
switch — `gh pr view <n> --json headRefName,state,mergedAt` — because a merged
or closed PR usually has no branch left to switch to, and the block below says
what to do in each case. **Never** reconstruct from a `HEAD` you have not
confirmed, and never switch a worktree that has uncommitted work belonging to a
different change — resolve that first or use another worktree.

With `HEAD` confirmed, resolve the name GitHub knows it by — **not** the local
one, and not the tracking ref either. Both can be absent or different: `_` and
`-` are equally valid locally and branch tooling may flatten `_` to `-` on
push, while this repo's own follow-up procedure pushes with
`git push origin <branch>` and no `-u`, which leaves a live remote branch, PR
and CI history behind **no tracking ref at all**. An unset `@{u}` therefore
proves nothing. Ask GitHub instead, and only conclude "never pushed" when it
says so:

```powershell
$local = git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
$alt   = $local -replace '^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})([_-])', { param($m)
           $m.Groups[1].Value + $(if ($m.Groups[2].Value -eq '_') { '-' } else { '_' }) }
function Find-Pr($head) {
  $out = gh pr list --head $head --state all --json number,headRefName,state,mergedAt --jq '.[0]'
  if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw 'PR lookup failed - do not read empty as no PR' }
  if ($out) { $out | ConvertFrom-Json }
}
$pr = Find-Pr $local
if (-not $pr -and $alt -ne $local) { $pr = Find-Pr $alt }
$branch = if ($pr) { $pr.headRefName }
          elseif ($u = (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref '@{u}' 2>$null)) { $u -replace '^origin/','' }
          else { $local }
$ref = git ls-remote --heads origin $branch
if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw 'remote lookup failed - do not read empty as absent' }
if (-not $ref -and $branch -ne $alt) {
  $ref = git ls-remote --heads origin $alt          # the other spelling
  if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw 'remote lookup failed - do not read empty as absent' }
  if ($ref) { $branch = $alt }                      # bind to the one that exists
}
```

**An empty result is only meaningful if the lookup succeeded**, and only after
both spellings have been tried. `_` and `-` are interchangeable after the date
prefix and the push may have flattened one into the other, so swap whichever
separator is there rather than assuming the local name uses the underscore.
Rebind `$branch` to the spelling that actually returned a ref; every
`origin/$branch` read below fails otherwise.

Check `$LASTEXITCODE`, not `$?`: a pipeline ending in `ConvertFrom-Json` reports
the *parser's* success, so a failed `gh` call that printed nothing reads as a
clean "no PR" — a guard that passes precisely in the case it exists to catch.
That sends pickup down the local-only path for a change with a PR and a full
review history.

**Keep `$pr.number`** — the PR reads further down need it, and if pickup started
from a branch name this lookup is the only place it appears.

**If `ls-remote` came back empty, the remote head is gone — which is not the
same as there being no record.** A PR outlives its branch here: the repo
auto-deletes the head ref on merge, and `refs/pull/<N>/head` keeps the range.
So decide on both signals, and on `$pr.mergedAt` — a deleted ref means merged or
abandoned, and those are opposite situations.

**Merged** (`$pr.mergedAt` set): the change already landed and there is nothing
*on the branch* to pick up. Do not reconstruct it. But check the worktree before
you close the question — a session can have left commits or uncommitted work on
top of what merged, and that is the only copy of it. Say so, point at the PR,
and ask dazewell what he actually wants — a follow-up is a new dated branch off
`dev` reusing the same `#<slug>`, per `nagramx-branch-flow`, not a resumption of
this one.

**Not merged, ref gone** — closed unmerged, or still open with its head ref
deleted: the change was abandoned, and that is a real pickup — but the branch is
gone and reviving it is a decision, not a default. An open PR in this state
looks live and has nothing behind it, so treat it the same way rather than
falling through to the fetch below, which would just fail. Report it and ask,
naming the recovery:
`git fetch origin "pull/$($pr.number)/head:<new-dated-branch>"` puts the range
back on a fresh branch, which is where the work would continue.

**Both of those stop and ask — and neither may stop without reading the tree
first.** They are the paths where the remote has nothing more to give, which is
exactly when local-only work is all that is left and easiest to write off. Get a
current comparison base, then read:

```powershell
git fetch origin dev
if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw 'fetch failed - origin/dev may be weeks stale' }
git status --short
git --no-pager log --oneline origin/dev..HEAD
```

A worktree abandoned weeks ago has an `origin/dev` to match, so comparing
against it unrefreshed reports commits as local that landed long ago. Name
anything you find in the question you ask. A terminal answer that silently
abandoned the only copy of something is the worst outcome this protocol has.

Only when `$pr` is empty *and* `ls-remote` is empty is the change genuinely
local-only: skip the `origin/$branch` reads below — they would just fail — run
the same `git fetch origin dev` with the same exit check for a comparison base,
and say plainly in your confirmation that local history was the whole record.
**The dirty-tree step below still applies here**, minus the fast-forward: a
local-only worktree is the case most likely to hold the only copy of something,
so read, decide and commit before reconstructing anything.

Otherwise bind to the remote head, so you reconstruct the newest state rather
than whatever the abandoned worktree happened to stop at — a session that died
may be several commits behind its own branch:

```powershell
git fetch origin dev $branch
if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw 'fetch failed - every read below would be stale' }
git status --short                                 # FIRST: anything uncommitted here?
git --no-pager log --oneline HEAD..origin/$branch  # commits on GitHub this worktree lacks
git --no-pager log --oneline origin/$branch..HEAD  # local commits GitHub does not have
```

**Settle `HEAD` here, before any of the reads below.** Everything downstream —
the diff, the CI result, the review threads — describes whatever `HEAD` points
at, and the fetch above moved only the remote-tracking ref. Read them against a
stale tip and you confirm, and then build on, a state you never inspected.

Two things have to happen first, in this order, and neither can be skipped:

1. **Read the uncommitted work and decide.** It is the only copy in existence
   and a fast-forward is the fastest way to lose it — it will either refuse and
   leave you improvising, or, worse, tempt a `reset --hard` that destroys it
   silently. `git status --short` names the paths but shows none of the content,
   and `git diff origin/dev...HEAD` excludes it entirely, so read it: `git
   --no-pager diff` and `git --no-pager diff --cached` for tracked changes, and
   open each untracked path. Decide explicitly whether to keep it, **commit**
   what you keep, and say what you chose. Prefer a commit over a stash — a stash
   is invisible to every command below and is exactly how the only copy goes
   missing; if you stash anyway, reapplying and verifying it is your obligation
   before you confirm anything.
2. **Then fast-forward.** Committing in step 1 moved `HEAD`, so re-read both
   ranges rather than trusting the ones above. Both non-empty means the branch
   has **diverged** — stop and report, rather than quietly reconstructing a fork
   of the change.

```powershell
git --no-pager log --oneline HEAD..origin/$branch  # re-read: step 1 may have moved HEAD
git --no-pager log --oneline origin/$branch..HEAD
git merge --ff-only origin/$branch                 # only if the reverse range is empty
```

With `HEAD` settled, read the change:

```powershell
git --no-pager log --oneline origin/dev..HEAD      # what landed, and its #slug
git --no-pager diff --stat origin/dev...HEAD       # the shape of the change
git --no-pager log --all --grep '#<slug>'          # related work on any other branch
git --no-pager diff origin/dev...HEAD              # finally, the change itself
```

**Does it compile?** `gh run list` alone does not answer that — it lists every
workflow, so a green `Commit tag check` reads as a passing build. Filter to the
gate and check it ran on *this* head:

```powershell
gh run list --branch $branch --workflow ci.yml --limit 5 `
  --json headSha,conclusion,createdAt --jq '.[]|"\(.headSha[0:9]) \(.conclusion)"'
git rev-parse --short=9 HEAD
```

A run on an older SHA says nothing about the current tree. **No run at all is
not a pass**, and it has two causes that need opposite answers: `ci.yml`
path-ignores doc, hook, agent and skill changes, so a doc-only branch
legitimately has none — but an event can also be dropped. Check the diff against
the workflow's `paths-ignore` before deciding. Every changed path ignored means
path-ignored; anything else means the gate is **missing**, which is a stop, not
a pass. Never report either as green.

**Only if a PR was found above**, read it — a branch abandoned without a
handoff often has no PR, and these commands are not runnable without one:

```powershell
gh pr view $pr.number                              # the body, and any <!-- handoff --> block
gh pr view $pr.number --comments                   # review findings and their dispositions
```

`--comments` shows the text but **not** whether a thread was resolved, and an
unresolved finding is the thing you most need to see. Read the resolution state
directly — the same `reviewThreads` query
`.github/agents/nagramx-implementer.agent.md` already uses:

```powershell
$q = 'query($endCursor:String) { repository(owner:"dazewell",name:"Dazegram"){ pullRequest(number:'+$pr.number+'){
  reviewThreads(first:100, after:$endCursor){ pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    nodes { isResolved path line comments(first:1){ nodes { body } } } } } } }'
gh api graphql --paginate -f query=$q --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | "\(if .isResolved then "resolved" else "OPEN" end) \(.path):\(.line)\n\(.comments.nodes[0].body)\n---"'
```

Print every thread, resolved ones included, with the comment text. An open
thread's location alone does not tell you what it found, and the resolved ones
are the record of what has already been settled — the main defence against
re-litigating it.

`--paginate` only follows the cursor when the variable is named **`$endCursor`**
and `pageInfo` is in the selection — any other name and it stops after the first
page, so an unresolved thread at 101 reads as a clean review.

With no PR, the local history and CI are the whole record. Say so in your
confirmation rather than leaving it ambiguous whether you looked.

**The uncommitted work was read and settled above, before `HEAD` moved** — that
is the one step out of order here on purpose, because it is the only one whose
input a fast-forward can destroy.

Then read `AGENTS.md` and `nagramx-workflow`. You are mid-pipeline, not exempt
from it — the compile gate, the review rounds and the `FEATURES.md` obligation
all still apply to the finished change.

## 2. The diff is authoritative

A handoff block tells you *why* things are as they are. It does not override
what the code says, and it may be several commits stale.

**Where they disagree, the code is right.** Say so plainly rather than quietly
picking one — a contradiction usually means work happened after the handoff was
written, which is itself something dazewell needs to know.

With no handoff at all, the commit messages and their `#<slug>` are your best
record; `git log --all --grep '#<slug>'` finds any earlier related work —
`--all` matters, because without it the search only walks commits reachable
from `HEAD` and misses fixes that live on other branches, which is the whole
point of searching.

## 3. Honour the dead ends

Anything recorded as a dead end is **already tested and rejected**. Do not
re-derive it to check. Re-running a failed approach is the single most expensive
thing you can do here — it burns the entire advantage of being a fresh session.

If you believe one was abandoned wrongly, **say so explicitly with your
reasoning before spending anything on it.** That is a decision to surface, not
to make silently.

With no handoff, treat an abandoned-looking approach in the diff — a half-built
mechanism, a commented-out branch — as a probable dead end and ask, rather than
finishing it on the assumption it was going somewhere.

## 4. Do not re-litigate settled ground

The hook point, the config surface, the UX decisions, and any architect finding
already dispositioned are **settled**. Reopening them turns a resumption into a
redesign, which is how a nearly-finished change becomes a new one.

If something settled looks genuinely wrong, raise it as a finding with
`file:line` evidence and let dazewell rule. Do not just build it differently —
silently shipping a variant of a rejected approach is the failure mode this
whole process exists to prevent.

**Equally, do not re-review the finished parts** *during reconstruction*. A
fresh crop of Minor observations on already-reviewed code is a cost, not
thoroughness. This does not excuse the change from the whole-feature and
craftsmanship passes `nagramx-workflow` step 5 requires on the **final** state —
those read the accumulation, including how the inherited code and your new work
interact, which is exactly what a resumed change is most likely to get wrong.

## 5. Confirm before you build

Reply with four short lines and wait:

- What you believe is **done**.
- What you are **picking up first**.
- Anything in the handoff the **diff contradicts**, or "nothing".
- Any **uncommitted work** you found, and what you did with it.

Get the reconstruction wrong here and you have lost nothing. Get it wrong
silently and you rebuild the same wall the last session hit.

## Then run the normal pipeline

From this point you are an ordinary implementer session on an ordinary change,
with `nagramx-workflow` governing the rest: compile gate, review round 2 on the
**whole final state** rather than your increment, `FEATURES.md` if user-visible,
any codemap fact the work established, and the PR.

One thing is easy to miss on a resumed change: **the final-state review matters
more than usual.** A change that arrived as two sessions' worth of increments
reads fine hunk-by-hunk and can still leave a muddled state machine. Review the
whole, not your part of it.

## Keeping this current

Edit here when the protocol changes. Bias to subtraction — this file is read
before any useful work starts, so every line is paid for up front.
