# Upstream traps

Non-obvious behaviour in base-fork code that has already bitten someone.
What the trap is, where it lives, and what it costs if you miss it.

## One `schedule_date` per forward batch

`TL_messages_forwardMessages` carries a single `schedule_date` field for the
**entire request**, set once on the request object
(`SendMessagesHelper.java:2628-2642`). Forwarding several messages at once
therefore lands every one of them on an identical scheduled timestamp — this
is the stock Telegram API request shape, not a fork defect. It is the root
cause of "I rescheduled one message and several others moved": the scheduled
list re-sorts around the resulting tie in `schedule_date`, which looks like
several messages moved together when only one send actually changed.
Distinct per-message times require distinct forward requests.

## Forwarding aliases the source message's media object

The forward path assigns the new local placeholder's media straight from the
source message rather than copying it —
`newMsg.media = msgObj.messageOwner.media` (`SendMessagesHelper.java:2398`).
`updateMediaPaths`, which reconciles the placeholder once the server confirms
the send, then mutates that same `TLRPC.MessageMedia` object in place — see
the photo-size and live-photo writes at `SendMessagesHelper.java:8759-8760`
and `:8780-8782`. Because of the alias, those writes land on the **original
forwarded message's media too**, not just the copy's.

This is upstream code, not a fork addition. Filed as
[#267](https://github.com/dazewell/Dazegram/issues/267). The copy-send route
avoids it because it builds fresh media from a local path instead of aliasing
(`tw/nekomimi/nekogram/helpers/MessageHelper.createSendingMediaInfo`).

## A shared `extension` variable leaks across a mixed document batch

`SendMessagesHelper.prepareSendingMedia`'s "send as documents" flush declares
one `extension` variable outside its per-item loop
(`SendMessagesHelper.java:10980`), reassigns it per item as each document is
queued (e.g. `:11534-11552`), and then passes its **final leftover value**
as the `mime` argument to every `prepareSendingDocumentInternal` call for the
whole batch (`SendMessagesHelper.java:11718`). A batch of documents with
different extensions therefore gets the wrong MIME type on most of its
members — and since audio-attribute extraction inside
`prepareSendingDocumentInternal` branches on the mime it's handed
(`SendMessagesHelper.java:9377-9396`), a mixed-extension album can also lose
audio attributes it should have kept.

## Sending a captured album as documents can split it by media type

`prepareSendingDocumentInternal` partitions a `groupId` by media type: when
the current item's derived `docType` differs from the previous item's, it
calls `finishGroup` and rotates to a fresh `groupId`
(`SendMessagesHelper.java:9646-9650`, types assigned at `:9631-9645`). That's
correct behaviour for an arbitrary multi-file share where the caller wants
photos and non-previewable files kept in separate groups. It's **wrong** for
a captured source album being resent as documents, where group membership
should follow the original album rather than get re-split by type. Passing
`docType == null` for that call suppresses the rotation, since the guard at
`:9646-9650` requires a non-null `docType` to fire.

## `canEditMessageScheduleTime` has no `id <= 0` guard

`MessageObject.canEditMessageScheduleTime`
(`MessageObject.java:11768-11783`) has no check on `message.id`, unlike its
siblings `canEditMessageAnytime` (`:11745-11766`, bails on `message.id < 0` at
`:11746`) and `canEditMessage` (starting `:11785`, same bail at `:11792`).

This is **not currently exploitable**: an outgoing message with `id <= 0`
that isn't a send-error resolves to `MESSAGE_TYPE_INVALID` in
`ChatActivity.getMessageType` (`ChatActivity.java:20537-20546`), and
`processRowSelect` refuses to select any row whose type is below
`MESSAGE_TYPE_MEDIA` — which `MESSAGE_TYPE_INVALID` (`-1`) is
(`ChatActivity.java:21147-21154`). The scheduled-message Reschedule path never
reaches a message in that state. Recorded here as a latent gap with its
shadowing guard so a future change to `getMessageType` or `processRowSelect`
doesn't silently reopen it.

## `ShareAlert.darkTheme` is the VoIP call-invite flag, not the app's dark theme

`ShareAlert.darkTheme` is assigned `= forCall` in the constructor
(`ShareAlert.java:452`). It has nothing to do with the app's light/dark theme
setting — it's true only for the VoIP call-invite variant of the share sheet.
The header-height ternary that appears throughout the file
(`dp(darkTheme && linkToCopy[1] != null ? 111 : 58)`, e.g.
`ShareAlert.java:1170`) branches on it, so a dark-looking screenshot of the
share sheet tells you nothing about which branch is live. The `ChatActivity`
channel-post share arrow constructs with `forCall = false`
(`ChatActivity.java:42773`), so for that entry point the branch is always the
plain `58`, regardless of the device's theme. Reasoning from how dark a
screenshot looks sends you to the wrong constant.

## `allowSelectChildAtPosition`'s `y` is already grid-local; adding `systemInsets.top` double-counts it

`ShareAlert`'s `gridView` and `searchGridView` both override
`allowSelectChildAtPosition(x, y)` to gate taps below the header
(`ShareAlert.java:1168`, `:1255`). The `y` handed in is local to the grid
itself — `containerView`'s `onLayout` already places every `Gravity.TOP` child,
including the grid, at `getPaddingTop() + topOffset`
(`ShareAlert.java:855`), and `containerView.onMeasure` sets that
`getPaddingTop()` to `systemInsets.top` (`ShareAlert.java:701`). So the
status-bar inset is already netted out of grid-local coordinates before the
guard ever runs.

Upstream 12.7.0 added a further `+ systemInsets.top` to the guard's threshold
anyway, double-counting the same inset and pushing the tap dead band down over
the entire first avatar row — a silent miss with no visual feedback, which
reads to a user as "the app ignored my tap" rather than as an error. The
identical `+ systemInsets.top` term is *correct* two hundred lines away, in
`containerView`'s own `onDraw` (`ShareAlert.java:928`, `:930`): there it
converts a grid-local `scrollOffsetY` into `containerView`'s own canvas space,
which is not padding-translated. Upstream applied that container-space
conversion to a value that was already grid-local. NagramX's fix removes the
extra term at both call sites, leaving `y >= dp(...)` with nothing added.

## Vendored `update to <version>` commits are single-parent squashes, not merges

Commits like `37bd22c0f4` ("update to 12.7.0 (6740)") that bulk-vendor an
upstream Telegram release have a single parent (`628eabc372`) rather than
being a 3-way merge. A fork fix living in a file one of these commits
rewrites is therefore **silently overwritten with no merge conflict to flag
it** — there's nothing to alert the next vendoring pass that a line it's about
to replace was deliberately changed. `ShareAlert.java` alone has been
rewritten by six such bumps since 2025-11. This is why a one-token fork fix in
a hot upstream file needs a `// NagramX:` comment explaining the *why*: the
comment is the only thing that survives to tell a future investigator the
line was intentional, since the diff itself won't.

## Release builds strip `Log.v` and `Log.d`

`TMessagesProj/proguard-rules.pro:173-176` has an `-assumenosideeffects` block
for `android.util.Log` that lists `v(...)` and `d(...)`, so R8 removes every
`Log.v` and `Log.d` call from the minified release variant. `Log.e`, `Log.i`
and `Log.w` are not listed and survive. Any diagnostic that has to appear on a
real device must use one of those three — a `Log.d` line compiles fine and then
emits nothing once installed.

The **local debug compile gate cannot catch this**:
`:TMessagesProj:compileDebugJavaWithJavac` builds the non-minified debug
variant, where the rule does not apply and `Log.d` works. The stripping only
happens in the minified release build that `staging.yml` produces — which is
the only variant that ever reaches a phone. So a `Log.d` diagnostic passes the
gate, passes CI, installs, and is silent, with nothing upstream of the device
to flag it.

Cost the `#repost-spread` instrumentation a full device test cycle: the
`NAX_SPREAD_DIAG` logging was written with `Log.d`, produced zero logcat output
on the installed staging APK, and had to be reissued at `Log.e`. Referenced by
[PR #270](https://github.com/dazewell/Dazegram/pull/270).
